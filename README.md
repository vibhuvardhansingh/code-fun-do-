## Present voting system
The right to vote is an inalienable part of a citizen‚Äôs right in a democracy, subject to certain conditions laid down by the state. As per the Election commission of India, citizens are eligible to become voters only if he/she is enrolled at place of residence. At present voting is done in EVMs.

## Current issues
1. Today due to the migration of people to cities because of healthy life style majority of voters are missing. This leads to uneven population in diferent constituencies.
2. Differnt political parties have questioned about the hacking done in EVMs. This can be great threat to democracy.
