## Present voting system
The right to vote is an inalienable part of a citizen‚Äôs right in a democracy, subject to certain conditions laid down by the state. As per the Election commission of India, citizens are eligible to become voters only if he/she is enrolled at place of residence. At present voting is done in EVMs.

## Current issues
1. Different political parties have questioned about the hacking done in EVMs. This can be great threat to democracy.
2. According to the source Wikipedia ,About 900 million people were eligible to vote and turnout was over 67 per cent.Their are many          reason that rest of them  have not vote but one reason is...
   A person may be living in a location other than the constituency where s/he is registered as a voter.So a person is not able to vote in    his constituencies which lead to partial voting win, in which everyone is not involve. 

## Solution of Current issues
1.Here we will use Azure Blockchain,which will make it impossible to hack EVMs and this will develop the belief in EVMs voting among the people and voting will happen securely. 
2. For this problem . We will use ML in which a person will open the app in the room and his mobile camera will identify that no other person and room cameras is present in his room then aperson will scan his Adhar card or Voter Id card and his face . After this ,a a person will vote and this vote will not be saved and can not be taken screenshot of it..This will help a person sitting different constituency to vote securely.
